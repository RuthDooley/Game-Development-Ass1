# Introduction
This submission represents Assignment 1, which involves the development of a 2D game for the module "Game Development" with the module code COMP30540. This was application is developed with Java with the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

# Description
This game is a basic 2D interpretation of the 3D simulation game “Overcooked!”. The aim of the game is to fulfil as many orders as quickly as possible as a team before the time runs out. This becomes more and more difficult as the game progresses as different obstacles make completing orders more challenging. For a greater explaination of the game features and controls see "Game Dev Assignment 1 Report.pdf" at the repo root.
